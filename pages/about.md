# **About Me**

Heyo! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br><br>
I'm currently an electrical/computer engineering student at the University of Toronto (ECE 2T8+PEY). I have an interest in low-level programming, cybersecurity, and circuit design. I used to do CTFs, specializing in binary exploitation. In my free time, you'll find me playing Pokemon TCG or Final Fantasy XIV.<br><br>
The programming languages I mostly work in are Perl, C, GDScript, and Java. I have some experience with Javascript, but not much. Some clubs I've been involved with are: Hi-Skule, UTRA ART, Project Metropolis, and the LGMB.<br><br>
Some of my interests include: retro gaming, lost media, modern/alternative rock, custom keyboards, electronics, and game development.
