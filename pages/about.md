# **About Me**

Heyo! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br><br>
I'm currently a high school student at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I., who has an interest in programming, along with electrical and computer engineering. In my free time, you'll find me working with Godot, working on my personal projects, reading, or doing CTFs. My CTF specialty is binary exploitation.<br><br>
The programming languages I mostly work in are Perl, C, GDScript, and Java. I have some experience with Javascript, but not much. You may know me from many different clubs, including (but not limited to!): Cybersecurity Club, MCPT, Engineering Club, Project Metropolis, and the Robotics Team.<br><br>
Some of my interests include: retro gaming, lost media, modern/alternative rock, custom keyboards, electronics, and game development.
